# CS6350-HW1
This is a machine learning library developed by Anh Tong for
CS5350/6350 in University of Utah

## Homework 1 - Decision Tree, how to run code on CADE machine.
 When you have the files on Linux CADE machines, MAKE SURE the rp.sh is in DecisionTree folder, DecisionTree folder is in CS6350-HW1 folder. 
1. First, open the rp.sh file, on the first line is: `cd /home/u1269555/Documents/CS6350-HW1/DecisionTree`, change the path according to yours. Whatever you do, last 2 elements (CS6350-HW1 and DecisionTree) have to be there: `cd /a/b/c/CS6350-HW1/DecisionTree`
  
2. Then in the terminal, cd to the path you just wrote. So it looks something like this: `cd /home/u1269555/Documents/CS6350-HW1/DecisionTree`
3. Then write: `chmod +x /home/u1269555/Documents/CS6350-HW1/DecisionTree/rp.sh`, change the path you rewrote in step 1, but remember to plug /rp.sh in the end, so yours should look something like this: `chmod +x /a/b/c/CS6350-HW1/DecisionTree/rp.sh`
4. Finally, run the file: `/home/u1269555/Documents/CS6350-HW1/DecisionTree/rp.sh`, once again, change the path, but do not forget last 3 elements. Now yours should look like this : `/a/b/c/CS6350-HW1/DecisionTree/rp.sh`.

And it should now run!

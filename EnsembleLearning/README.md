## EnsembleLearning is the folder for question 2 only! For question 4, go to LinearRegression folder


### Note
There will be 4 plots saved to this folder if you execute `run.sh`, 
1. *f1_AdaBoost.png*, for first figure of question 2a
2. *f2_AdaBoost.png*, for second figure of question 2a
3. *plot_for_Bagging.png*, for question 2b
4. *RandomForest.png*, for 2d

### How to use script to run the code
1) cd to EnsembleLearning folder: `your/path/to/file/CS6350-HW2/EnsembleLearning`
2) `chmod +x run.sh` so you're able to run the script
3) `run.sh` to run , then you are done, but there's something else you need, read **2nd Note**!

### 2nd Note:
After finishing 2a, 2b, question 2c will ask if you want to run it, because it's taking slow so it's best to skip it and go for 2d first. Then comeback, execute the code (of course you have to wait for it to be done 2a, 2b, but it will take roughly 30 min), then execute 2c. 
**Be careful with 2c**, it took me more than 24 hours to finish 100 repeats with 500 trees each repeat. So i might have to revise the id3 algorithm in the future, but right now, **it is not fast**. That's why i include the text file as my result for 2c!
